  <p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.6rem; line-height:2; max-width:1000px; margin:25px auto 0 auto;">The Loop is GW’s free clothing exchange store on the Mount Vernon Campus. 
        All the inventory is sourced from clothing donations from GW community members. 
        Each year, the Office of Sustainability receives more than 25,000 pounds’ worth 
        of clothing donations — promoting reuse and reducing textile waste.</p>
